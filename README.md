## Getting Started

This project was created to study the importance of the development of scraper solutions and their application in Ruby.

### Prerequisites

Computer running [Mac OS](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/), [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10), or [Linux Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download). [Ruby V.3.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/)...

### Install

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

- You need to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [download as zip file](https://www.itprotoday.com/mobile-management-and-security/how-do-i-download-files-github) the repository on your device.
- [Unzip](http://www.e7z.org/open-zip.htm) the repository or just clone it using git or github.
- Grab the enumerable_methods.rb file and open it on your favorite online code editor, for example [repl.it.](https://replit.com/)
- If you want to see the source code of the files located in my repository, you can do it through a [code editor of your choice](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/best-code-editors), I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), first, you must [install it by following these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), then you must [open the folder containing my repository in your local repository](https://thisdavej.com/right-click-on-windows-folder-and-open-with-visual-studio-code/#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20navigate%20to,with%20VS%20Code%E2%80%9D%20as%20well.) and [open each of the files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) to see their content.
- if you want to do coding tests to this repository you can do it with [RSpec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSpec), you must first open your terminal in the path where you downloaded the repository, after that, it will execute the `gem install rspec` code, once the installation is finished, it will proceed to verify the version of RSpec through the command in the terminal `rspec --version`, once the version is verified, it will proceed to execute the command `rspec --init` to start RSpec in your local repository, once these steps are completed, you will only have to run the `rspec` command to run the tests to this repository.
- If you have any questions or problems about how to run this project, you can leave me a comment in the [issues section](https://github.com/aristides1000/ruby_capstone_project_scraper/issues) of this repository, I am more than willing to help you.

### Usage
Run main_scraper.rb with [Ruby V.3.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/).

### Run tests
